Usage
Customer List
The main page displays a list of all customers in a card layout. Each card shows the customer's name, phone number, and email. Clicking on a card navigates to the customer's detailed information page.

Customer Details
The customer details page displays comprehensive information about a selected customer:

Personal Information: Name, phone, and email.
Addresses: A list of all addresses associated with the customer.
Current Cart: Items currently in the customer's cart, with quantities and total prices for duplicate items.
Order History: A list of past orders, including order IDs, types, dates, total amounts, and statuses.
Payment History: A list of payments made by the customer, including payment IDs, modes, dates, amounts, and statuses.
Customization
Styling
You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the CSS in CustomerList.css. Adjust the card styles, hover effects, and other UI elements to match your design preferences.

API Integration
Ensure that your backend API endpoints are correctly configured in AdminService.js to fetch the required customer data. Modify the service functions if your API structure differs from the assumed format.
